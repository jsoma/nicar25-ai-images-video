## Setup and installation

Avoid setup and just [use these notebooks on Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/jsoma/nicar25-ai-images-video/).

### NICAR computer setup instructions you can use

Open up **Terminal** (it's a little black box down at the bottom of the screen), copy and paste this and hit enter:

```
cd ~/Desktop/hands_on_classes/20250307-friday-analyzing-images-and-videos-with-ai
source env/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```

It should open up a browser with some *stuff* in it.

### Your own machine

Various Pythons may or may not work for this â€“ I use 3.10 or 3.11, not exactly sure about more recent ones. I think all of the `pip install` commands are in the Jupyter notebooks themselves, so you shouldn't need anything on that front. Maybe `brew install ffmpeg`, depending on what you're up to.
