    "# Understanding videos with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be using [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), which has [a really nice cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) of examples and walkthroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when we're talking about AI we're talking about **LLMS**, Large language models. In this case Gemini (and the other popular models) aren't actually just *language* models, they're *multimodal models*, which means they can take things other than text. GPT can do things like PDFs and images, but Gemini is magical because **it can process videos**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might be used to talking to AI tools through [the chat interface](https://gemini.google.com/app) we're going to be working through Python code. Technically this is called an **API**, which is a fancy way of saying \"computers talking to other computers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating a connection to Gemini. To do this we'll need an **API key**, which is your access code. It's kind of like a username and password, so don't share it with the world! You can find guidance on how to create your own [right here](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook?tab=readme-ov-file#1-quick-starts). For now we'll use mine!"
