    "# Transcribing videos\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might you transcribe videos? Because watching each and every video takes *so long!* To see a use case, check out Lam Thuy Vo's [Misinformation on TikTok: How 'Documented' Examined Hundreds of Videos in Different Languages](https://pulitzercenter.org/misinformation-tiktok-how-documented-examined-hundreds-videos-different-languages), or any of the ten thousand projects local newsrooms are doing about transcribing community meetings from YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "> YouTube transcripts are awful. Terrible. So bad. Don't ever trust them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our favorite (local, DIY) transcription tool: Whisper\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI has released other AI tools besides ChatGPT – one of the most popular is [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), a model that can **transcribe audio**. The fact, technical name for this is \"speech to text.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GPT, **you can actually download and use Whisper**. Python programmers can bop on over to [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and coding with it minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Whisper is freely available to use and adapt, you'll see all sorts of Whisper-powered tools out there. [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) allows you to transcribe audio from the safety of your mac - powered by Whisper! [This random website](https://whisperui.com/) allows to drag-and-drop audio files and transcribe them on the web – powered by Whisper!\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we'll do the exact same thing right here, in Python – powered by Whisper!\n",
    "\n",
    "## But... Whisper is actually bad!\n",
    "\n",
    "[According to everyone](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14), and the excellently-named paper [Careless Whisper: Speech-to-Text Hallucination Harms](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3658996), Whiper makes *a lot of bad mistakes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> In an example they uncovered, a speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But the transcription software added: “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece ... I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.”\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems is **silence**. Like human beings, Whisper isn't very good at dealing with silence! It's trained to transcribe transcribe transcribe, so when there's silence it tends to start writing regardless of what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this is **voice activity detection**, which cuts out silences before it transcribes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we can use [the original Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for transcription, other people have build *other* Python tools on top of it. As a result, we have great libraries like [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) which had add-ons like VAD, speaker diarization (splitting speakers!) and more. It's a little more unwieldy to use, but it's worth it."

      " Hello and welcome to Vancouver Carpenter. If you're new to drywall, picking the right mud can be kind of a daunting task with so many different types. We've got light mud, we've got all purpose, we've got heavyweight, we've got topping, we've got joint. So it's hard to know exactly which mud to choose.  So I'm going to help break that down for you so you can know which one to pick. We're also going to do this in the order that we tape with. So first we're going to start with quick set mugs. So these are the powdered mugs that are bought in bag form. So one of the ones we use a lot here in Western Canada and this isn't available everywhere but it's called concrete fill. So the specific purpose of this mud right here  is actually for skimming out concrete ceilings. So it's got really good adhesion and it's got some light aggregate in it, which I believe is something like pear light. So it's squishy, not like sand.  So that's for skimming out ceilings. It has a really great floatability, but you're not gonna find it everywhere. Hamilton Ultra Fill is another product. It's the same product, basically, just in a different bag from a different company. So we use this for floating big areas, filling large voids. I also use it for jobs where I'm taping with mesh tape. It's a quick setting compound that has about an hour to set. So next, let's get into another quick set. So this one is just your standard 20-minute lead. This is a certain teeth product.  Light sand plus it says light sand because it's supposed to be sandable, but it's not very sandable So this is another product that is suitable for taping with  mesh tape on patches and jobs that you're just not worried about cracking. So this stuff is very hard. It doesn't shrink and I mostly just use it for pre-fill or jobs where I'm trying to get in and out in a day. It sets in about 20 to 30 minutes so you can apply subsequent coats. Now something that most people don't understand about setting muds  They are quick set, not quick drive. If you apply three coats in one day, you still need to wait three or four days for that to drive properly. All it does is allow you to apply a bunch of coats in one day so you don't have to do multiple trips. And it also allows you to do deep fills, like you can fill things up to easily half inch deep, if not deeper, without it shrinking and cracking. So it doesn't do all the weird things that regular mud will do.  So once you've done your pre-filling, the next thing to go on to is some sort of a taping mud. So here in Canada we have what's called light taping mud. So this one says light weight taping.  And this box here is also a taping mud. So in Canada, all of our mud is light. So what that means is in the states, there's actually heavyweight mud. And we'll get into that a little bit when I get into all purpose. So this mud is specifically for laying paper tape. It doesn't coat nicely. It gets bubbles.  And it shrinks a lot and it's harder to sand. So it's specifically for laying tape. It has tons of glue in it. And because it's light, it's not too heavy if you're using, say, automatic taping tools or just carrying around a pan of mud is not too heavy. So next we're going to get into all purpose months. So right here, I have light all purpose.  So it's important to make a distinction. I've been saying light a lot and that's because pretty much all mods up here in Canada are light. And what that means is I'm not sure when they stopped using the regular heavyweight formula and switched over to light. It was maybe in the 80s or 90s.  But a heavyweight mud like your regular sheet rock green lid, USG or your pro form black lid, these mugs that you guys have down in the States that is a regular heavyweight mud is literally twice the weight. You lift up a bucket of  that. If you're a Canadian and you go to pick up a bucket of heavyweight and you've been lifting lightweight buckets your whole life you're gonna oh my goodness because this stuff is just heavy it's a totally different beast and a lot of the time I've been on drywall forms where Canadian tapers are giving the Americans a really hard time. What are you taping with all purpose for?  The thing is, us Canadians don't know that in the states there's a lot of places that don't have taping mud and they don't have light mud. They only have this all-purpose stuff. It's a real bear to work with. It stands horribly, so it's a totally different animal than the light muds we have up here in Canada. Very sticky and very strong.  So let's get into the Canadian lightweight all purpose. So you can tape with it, but it is not as good as a regular mud. So I'd say a light all purpose mud for taping is good enough to give the customer a tailgate warranty. And what that means is when you can't see the tailgate of the contractor anymore, your warranty is expired.  So I carry this stuff around because it's all right for taping things like inside corners and it's good for taping things in a pinch and it also has better adhesion over say glossy paints and things like that than your classic finish. All purpose mud is also one of the only things you should be coating steel beads with.  The real question is, why are you still installing steel beads? So next let's get into finished muds. So right here we've got a classic finish, which just means it's a topping mud. So this mud is not suitable for taping. It is not suitable for coating steel or vinyl beads. But what it is suitable for is getting nice smooth coats with relatively few bubbles on your first coat. And it polishes out really nicely on your final coat. It's also easier to sand.  So in terms of hardness of sanding, taping and the heavyweight all purpose, you don't want to sand that stuff. Light all purpose is pretty darn easy to sand. A comparable product in the States would be USG plus 3. That's a light all purpose. But this stuff is very easy to sand.  If you use a coarse grit of sandpaper like a 120 or sometimes even a 150 on a finish mud, you're going to scratch the crap out of it. So it's very easy to sand, but that also means that you need to be more careful with it when sanding and that it's not going to leave as durable a finish on the customer's wall.  Although in all honesty, we're talking about drywall, not plaster concrete. No matter what drywall you're using, it's going to leave a cheap finish on the wall because drywall's a cheap product, but that's a whole other debate. So the ideal scenario for using something like an all-purpose is when you're doing a really small job like a bunch of patches or a small bathroom.  So you're going to use mesh tape and quick set on your flats and your butt joints and you're going to use paper tape and all purpose for your inside corners. I would probably also install my corner beads with quick set and you're going to get a first coat on everything and a coat on your inside corners with the all purpose and then you're going to do a finished coat with the all purpose.  So it's handy to have if you don't want to carry two different buckets around. You just want one bucket for one job. So for large jobs, what I like to have is I like to have a bag called fill for the deep fills and for pre-filling everything. I like to have taping mud and paper tape because it's the strongest and longest lasting. And then I like to have finished mud because it spreads the nicest and because I get the least pinholes and it sands easily.  So this is for big jobs and then the quick set and then all purpose for the little jobs. So I hope that helps answer some of your questions if you've been wondering about what are all these different types of drywall mods and maybe get a little overwhelmed when you're at the Home Depot.

      " Hello and welcome to Vancouver Carpenter. If you're new to drywall, picking the right mud can be kind of a daunting task with so many different types. We've got light mud, we've got all purpose, we've got heavy weight, we've got topping, we've got joint. So it's hard to know exactly which mud to choose.  So, I'm going to help break that down for you so you can know which one to pick. We're also going to do this in the order that we tape with. So, first we're going to start with quick set muds. So, these are the powdered mugs that are bought in bag form. So, one of the ones we use a lot here in Western Canada, and this isn't available everywhere, but it's called concrete fill. So, the specific purpose of this mud, right here,  is actually for skimming out concrete ceilings. So it's got really good adhesion and it's got some light aggregate in it, which I believe is something like perlite. So it's squishy, not like sand.  So that's for skimming out ceilings. It has really great floatability, but you're not going to find it everywhere. Hamilton Ultra Fill is another product. It's the same product, basically, just in a different bag from a different company. So we use this for floating big areas, filling large voids. I also use it for jobs where I'm taping with mesh tape. It's a quick setting compound that has about an hour to set. So next, let's get into another quick set. So this one is just your standard 20 minute mud.
